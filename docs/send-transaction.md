# How to send transaction in Mask Network plugin?

> The EVM-compatible chains version.

Suppose we need to integrate the [SimpleStorage](https://github.com/ConsenSys/quorum-dev-quickstart/blob/master/files/common/smart_contracts/contracts/SimpleStorage.sol) contract into Mask Network.

## Import ABI

The first step is to introduce the contract in the TypeScript way. Mask Network uses [TypeChain](https://github.com/dethcrypto/TypeChain) to transform ABIs into type definitions. It's easy to do with few steps.

#### Create `SimpleStorage.json`

To create a new file `packages/web3-contracts/evm/SimpleStorage.json` with below ABI inside. You can find the ABI of the contract from the source repository on the Github or the etherscan if the deployer has verified it. Here is the ABI what we need to import.

```json
[
  {
    "inputs": [
      {
        "internalType": "uint256",
        "name": "initVal",
        "type": "uint256"
      }
    ],
    "stateMutability": "nonpayable",
    "type": "constructor"
  },
  {
    "inputs": [],
    "name": "get",
    "outputs": [
      {
        "internalType": "uint256",
        "name": "retVal",
        "type": "uint256"
      }
    ],
    "stateMutability": "view",
    "type": "function"
  },
  {
    "inputs": [
      {
        "internalType": "uint256",
        "name": "x",
        "type": "uint256"
      }
    ],
    "name": "set",
    "outputs": [],
    "stateMutability": "nonpayable",
    "type": "function"
  },
  {
    "inputs": [],
    "name": "storedData",
    "outputs": [
      {
        "internalType": "uint256",
        "name": "",
        "type": "uint256"
      }
    ],
    "stateMutability": "view",
    "type": "function"
  }
]
```

#### Create `SimpleStorage.d.ts`

Then we change the directory into `packages/web3-contracts` and run command `npm run start` in it. It will create a definition file of the contract and we will need it in later sections.

```bash
cd packages/web3-contracts
npm run start

cat types/SimpleStorage.d.ts
```

Here is the generated definition file.

```ts
/* Autogenerated file. Do not edit manually. */
/* tslint:disable */
/* eslint-disable */

import BN from 'bn.js'
import { ContractOptions } from 'web3-eth-contract'
import { EventLog } from 'web3-core'
import { EventEmitter } from 'events'
import {
  Callback,
  PayableTransactionObject,
  NonPayableTransactionObject,
  BlockType,
  ContractEventLog,
  BaseContract,
} from './types'

interface EventOptions {
  filter?: object
  fromBlock?: BlockType
  topics?: string[]
}

export interface SimpleStorage extends BaseContract {
  constructor(jsonInterface: any[], address?: string, options?: ContractOptions): SimpleStorage
  clone(): SimpleStorage
  methods: {
    get(): NonPayableTransactionObject<string>

    set(x: number | string | BN): NonPayableTransactionObject<void>

    storedData(): NonPayableTransactionObject<string>
  }
  events: {
    allEvents(options?: EventOptions, cb?: Callback<EventLog>): EventEmitter
  }
}
```

ðŸŽ‰ Now, we have imported the ABI in the TypeScript way.

### Import Constants

To locate the real code on the chain. We need to tell where to find the smart contract. We can only locate it by a specific chain id and contract address. In Mask Network, it can be written as `web3-constants`. A Web3 constant maps a name to various values on different chains. We can create `simple-storage.json` for this project.

```bash
cat packages/web3-constants/simple-storage.json
```

```json
{
  "SIMPLE_STORAGE_ADDRESS": {
    "Mainnet": "",
    "Ropsten": "",
    "Rinkeby": "",
    "Kovan": "",
    "Gorli": "",
    "BSC": "",
    "BSCT": "",
    "Matic": "",
    "Mumbai": "",
    "Arbitrum": "",
    "Arbitrum_Rinkeby": "",
    "xDai": ""
  }
}
```

> ðŸ’¬ It's not a problem to just leave other networks as blank strings expect the Rinkeby network for a in development project.

After that, we import the JSON file into `packages/web3-shared/evm/constants/index.ts`. Let us be able to share the constant to the total codebase.

```ts
export const getSimpleStorageConstants = transform(SimpleStorage)
export const useSimpleStorageConstants = hookTransform(getSimpleStorageConstants)
```

As we can read from the function name. These two functions are used in different purposes. The `useSimpleStorageConstants` can only be used in a React component. The other one can go everywhere.
